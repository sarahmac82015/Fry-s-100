This is an unpolished first round version created by a single prompt in Chat GPT 4.0 for the purpose of Fry's Sight Word mastery in an American public school 3rd grade classroom.
It is to be ran web-based for a student chromebook deployed off Vercel.
This is the first of many games I will use my chat gpt LLM model agent to create for my students.  
Chat gpt just told me I needed to import the Fry's 100 wordlist.  It and I don't knoiw what each other don't know. lol
